Heya, I'm Hestray, but I also go by Astervoid or Emma! I'm a 20 yo automation engineering student with one too many passions and too little time.

I've developed an interest in maths and physics early on and ever since then, my plan was to go into a field that requires research. Yet only a few years later I decided that my best bet at making a breakthrough is by investing myself into coding and starting from there. And here I am right now!
